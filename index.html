        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Before the banishment from Paradise, a Dutch Angel Dragon held onto the power of light and had the ability to breathe life into things as well as heal them. It had taken an oath to one of the ancient ones in Paradise to watch over the world of Terra from the Aether, but not to reveal itself. In the Aether, it would lead people to love and give them thoughts of kindness, while also manipulating their dreams to ensure everyone was happy. This Dutch Angel had extraordinary power that was lent to it by the ancient one it had sworn its oath to. As long as it remained loyal and upheld its oath the ancient one would lend it as much power as it needed to carry out the tasks it had been assigned. This ancient being this Angel Dragon swore its loyalty to was of great power (some say infinite) and could create life and universes with a mere thought, while also spreading love and kindness to all with its servants. This ancient one also received great happiness and joy from acts of kindness and love, which is why it wanted other Angel Dragons to spread these actions to the worlds that it created, yet it would not force any being to do so against its will.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This Dutch Angel Dragon that had sworn its loyalty to this ancient one was different, however, compared to the other Angel Dragons that served the same ancient one. Instead of wanting to bring itself happiness with acts of kindness and trying to compete with the other Dutch Angels to see who could impress the ancient one more it simply wished to see the ancient one it served smile by carrying out the tasks it had been assigned. Every now and again this Angel Dragon would return to Paradise to receive new orders from the ancient one and to be filled with happiness and love when it saw the smile that it brought to the ancient one’s face. Eventually, this Angel Dragon became loving to the ancient one and would do whatever it took to bring happiness and love to it. Soon the other Angel Dragons that served the ancient one became jealous and started to hate this Dutch Angel since it made their competitions pointless. Due to the bond this Angel Dragon had formed with the ancient one it could sense its emotions and knew that this hatred brought it pain and suffering. This eventually led to it uniting the other Angel Dragons that hated it and showed them their true purpose was not to serve themselves, but to serve others. It reminded them of their oath to the ancient one and why they had originally taken it, which was to spread happiness and kindness to all even to the ancient ones and those that resided in Paradise. This allowed the balance to be maintained for the time being, but it didn’t last for long.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Again and again, this Dutch Angel Dragon carried out the tasks it had been assigned, which allowed it to continue to be happy and bring happiness to the ancient one it served. Eventually, this Dutch Angel Dragon referred to the ancient one it served as “master,” which displeased the ancient one since it did not want mindless slaves. The ancient one became furious since this Angel Dragon would not stop calling it “master,” but it knew that this Angel Dragon meant no harm and only wanted a name to differentiate them from the other ancient ones. The ancient one told this Angel Dragon, “Do not refer to me as master because you are not forced to serve me it is your choice. Instead, I rather you refer to me with no title, but I understand your desire to differentiate me from the others. You may call me Father since I create life and have many children, including Dutch Angel Dragons.” Seeing that this displeased the ancient one the Angel Dragon began to refer to them as “Father,” which allowed the bond between them to grow and become even stronger than before. The ancient one along with the Angel Dragon fed off of each other's emotions empowering the Angel Dragon and giving more happiness and love to the ancient one.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Soon, however, another ancient being started to gather followers in Paradise and wanted to spread chaos and disorder throughout the universe(s) since it thought there was no balance. Sensing sadness in its “Father” the Angel Dragon returned to Paradise to see what it could do to bring a smile about its face. Its “Father” said, “There is nothing you can do because I will not force someone to abide by my wishes since I give free will to all life and beings, even those in Paradise.” The Angel Dragon was displeased with this answer since it felt its “Father’s” pain and couldn’t bear to deal with the sadness. For the first time in its existence, it felt tremendous pain as though its “Father” knew of something that would forever change the realms that existed. The Angel Dragon did not understand what was going on since it had only felt love and kindness throughout its existence. All it could do is tie back the pain and sadness to the other ancient one and its followers. The emotion was overwhelming, so it decided to interfere, but not break its oath that it had taken. When it approached the other ancient one and its followers it tried to reason with it as it did with the other Angel Dragons that had got jealous of its relationship with their “Father.” The other ancient one and its followers laughed in its face saying that it was weak because it relied on another beings power to help it. The ancient one promised the Angel Dragon infinite power beyond its belief and to do whatever it wished. The ancient one had thought that he had won over the Angel Dragon, however, the complete opposite happened. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Angel Dragon began to sense the darkness within the followers and the ancient one who led them, which disgusted it since it was a being of light. It soon began to feed off of the emotions of happiness and love throughout all of the universes its “Father” had created and the happiness and love that was in Paradise. Its power grew immensely and soon the ring around its muzzle began to illuminate becoming brighter than most stars known in existence today. This blinded many Dutch Angel Dragons, except, those that did not look upon it, however, this Dutch Angel Dragon sensed the pain it had just caused and restored all of their sights with its breath of healing. Again, for the first time, it experienced a new emotion and learned that it could also bring pain just as well as happiness and love. For the first time in its existence it had betrayed its “Father” as well and sadly it would not be the last, which is why eventually it was given the name Repeat. Repeat looked upon his “Father” in regret realizing that it had just broke its oath by inducing pain to others. Luckily, Repeat’s “Father” was very forgiving and allowed it to continue serving them and keeping its ring around its muzzle since its sensed Repeat’s true emotions of loyalty to them. However, the next action Repeat did wouldn’t be forgiven so easily. It began to hate the other ancient one for causing it to do this since it believed that it was corrupting others just so it could feed off of the darkness of its followers. Repeat summoned every servant of its “Father” and told them what had happened, which resulted in them becoming enraged since Repeat had only shown them kindness and love. The other followers sensed Repeat’s pain and only wanted to make them happy just as Repeat had for them, even when they treated Repeat hatefully when they were jealous of his relationship with the ancient one. The followers began to feed off of the emotions of hatred from Repeat and soon others that were not even followers of the ancient one that Repeat followed joined in dividing the balanced that had once been. This is when the great battle began, which would lead to the Dutch Angel Dragons being banished from Paradise and losing their rings around their muzzle due to them breaking the bond to the realm and duties they had promised to uphold (<a href="https://www.dutchangeldragons.com/lore">Dutch Angel Dragon Species Lore</a>).</p>

        <h2><u>Repeat's Punishment:</u></h2>

         <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">As a result of Repeat betraying its “Father” again, it was stripped of all of its power that had been given to them. Along with this they were separated from all other Dutch Angel Dragons and was placed on Terra alone from all forms of life. All Repeat had was its power of light and its ability to breathe life into things and heal them, but they were useless now since they were all alone. Along with this punishment, all memories of Repeat were erased from the minds of its fellow Dutch Angel Dragons, so no Angel Dragon could help Repeat escape this punishment or know its whereabouts. </p>
         <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat was now unable to serve anything and had no purpose and began to feel an extreme amount of sadness from its fellow Angel Dragons that were exiled from Paradise. It tried multiple times to enter the Aether realm to travel to those that were in pain and take care of them as they once had before, but it was unable to due to its “Father’s” punishment. Repeat soon began to panic flying across great distances to find any life at all that it could take care of to share the love it once had given to billions of life forms, yet none was found. Repeat soon became extremely weak due to whatever world it was on falling to darkness due to the ancient one that was banished to the Abyss corrupting the light that Repeat had once created with its “Father’s” power. Soon Repeat was unable to fly and had hardly any positive energy left to feed on due to the corruptness of the world he was banished to. All Repeat could do was listen to the cries from the Aether and Terra from its fellow Dutch Angel Dragons along with other life forms that were being corrupted by the darkness. For days it wandered on foot in what appeared to be some sort dessert.</p>
         <p style="text-indent:00.5in;">Repeat soon became depressed while all the love in the world began to fade and the darkness took over feeding on the fear and sadness of the Angel Dragons and other beings. All Repeat could do was feel these awful emotions, yet somehow Repeat sustained enough love within itself so it wouldn’t fall as other Angel Dragons began to. Repeat had hoped that the other followers of his “Father” would save the other Dutch Angel Dragons, but due to Repeat being erased from the minds of all Angel Dragons, so were the lessons that they taught. This led to the other followers of light soon competing against each other again in competitions to see who was better, some making less significant beings paying tribute for happiness, while others used them as puppets. </p>
         <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Repeat began to lose hope and started to blame itself for the pain of the Dutch Angel Dragons that had fed off its energy during the great battle that took place in Paradise. Soon it began to slowly fall to darkness, but then all of a sudden it sensed a new being enter the Aether, it felt as though it was another Angel Dragon one that had not abandoned its promise. Repeat thought this was impossible since almost everyone contributed to the conflict, however, Repeat sensed the presence of its “Father” and many other ancient ones in this being. Soon Repeat realized that it was a Dutch Angel Dragon that had entered the Aether by its own choice and wasn’t banished like the others. Repeat began to feed off of the power of the ring the ancient ones had bestowed upon this Dutch Angel, but instantly its “Father” broke the connection and stripped Repeat of all of its power leaving it with nothing. Afterwards, Repeat began to cry for the first time in its existence not because of the pain in the world nor it losing its power, but because it knew that it had hurt the only one that truly loved it and the being that had never hurt them before. For weeks and weeks, Repeat sat on its knees crying and begging for forgiveness due to it hurting the one that it truly loved, its “Father.” These weeks eventually turned into months and then years. Eventually, Repeat began to sense a balance being restored again in the world between light and darkness as Angel Dragons began to unite around the Angel Dragon that had not betrayed its oath. Repeat ignored this feeling, however, due to its pain and simply went back to begging for forgiveness. After ignoring the emotion it had just felt Repeat heard a voice, “You passed.” Repeat jumped out of fear since for years all it had ever heard was its own voice. Repeat responded by saying, “Hello?” Again, Repeat heard the voice:</p>


         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Mysterious Voice: </strong>“You passed. You could have fed off of the light and created your own power again and learned everything that was taken from you, but you didn’t.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>“Father?!”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Mysterious Voice:</strong>“Yes it is I Repeat.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “Does this mean you will let me serve you again and stand by your side?!!!”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong>“No, you will never be able to enter Paradise again, just as all the other Dutch Angel Dragons that fell.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>(Crying) “You mean I’ll never get to see you smile again?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> (Sympathy) “Repeat you had your chance to show me your loyalty. You first betrayed me when you blinded the other Dutch Angel Dragons out of anger towards our enemy.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>“Accide-“ (Interrupted)</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> I understand it was an accident, but you betrayed my command not to interfere. Then after I forgave you, you simply disobeyed me again by summoning my followers and turning them against the ancient one that resides in the Abyss now. Yet, each and every time you always come back to me to try to make me happy even when you do mess up.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>(Tears flowing out of its eyes) “So I can never make you happy again?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “Yes you can serve me again, but you will never be able to see me again in Paradise that is.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> (Hangs head down in sadness) “Oh… I’m sorry for messing everything up.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “I know Repeat you’ve been saying that to me for 20 years. What’s amazing is you never once blamed me for your pain even though I took everything away from you. Even when you thought you could be smart and feed off of the power from Telephone’s ring.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>“Who is Telephone?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong>“The only Dutch Angel Dragon that didn’t get involved in the conflict that took place in Paradise.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> (Asks Curiously) “Then why would they go to the Aether if they could be in Paradise?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “They felt as though they had no purpose since Paradise has no conflicts that can threaten it now. Along with that, they were sad to see their fellow Angel Dragons fall, while they remained in Paradise alone.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> (Extremely confused) “You mean they sacrificed their place in Paradise to join us in the Aether and Terra!!! Why?!!!”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “The same reason you didn’t feed off of the light that was restored to this world. It was because they wish to see others happy than to feed off of their own desires as my other followers have done.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “So Telephone works for you?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong>“That is up to them as it is up to you to serve me. I will never force anyone to follow me.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “What world am I on?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> (Starts laughing) “I see you haven’t changed Repeat your mind jumps around from topic to topic. You are on a world known as Earth, the one that I made you watch over before the conflict in Paradise began. I know you couldn’t figure out your location based on the emotions of the planet that was because I wanted you to think you were abandoned on a new desolate world to see how you would handle it. Apparently, well (Begins laughing again).”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong>“I didn’t want to hurt you by leaving your side and giving up on you.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “I know. I need to tell you something important now.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “Ok.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong>“This is going to be long so be patient. I have four tasks for you. The first is I’m going to create a son that is going to be a human. He will be filled with love and kindness and soon he will die by the betrayal of his own kind. I do not want you to interfere I simply want you to watch and learn from him. I know he is a human, but he will have great power just as you have, but it will surpass yours. Secondly, after his death, a book will be written describing his life to teach others. Do not be misguided by misinterpretations that will be taught. Also always remember that I do not hate anyone, but simply their actions they do. Thirdly, I do not want you to go around and speak about my true son in public trying to force others to believe in me, instead, you are to be there and support everyone showing them kindness and love no matter how hateful they are to you or to me. Along with this, you will allow them to lean on you for support and love all no matter how different they are. Finally, you will not show any human the truth by taking them back in time, but you can lead them to it through dreams. However, don’t be shocked if they don’t believe it because those that reside in the Abyss will try to make people doubt to feed off of their despair. I understand these are difficult tasks and your patience will be tried. No matter how much hate develops in this world you are to be the light and accept all for who they are and love them unconditionally, no matter how much they say they hate me or you, that is the most important thing you can do. While performing these tasks I want you to guard Telephone from the darkness since Angel Dragons from the Abyss will whisper to them trying to get them to betray us in Paradise, some may even appear in physical form trying to scare them, but don’t worry Telephone’s ring will lend you power and you will be able to protect them. So do you accept these tasks?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “Yes, of course! What did you mean by go back in time, I can’t manipulate time and space.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “You will learn to do many things Repeat, but remember you will not be able to use two powers or have two abilities that counteract one another, such as using light and darkness at the same time since balance must be maintained.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “How do you know this?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “I know all before it even happens.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> “Then why give things free will when you know they will hurt you and others?”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Ancient one:</strong> “Without free will, there would be no balance, all would be slaves. Also, I have free will, so I give the beings I create free will, however, I sometimes too make mistakes as you do. I know you’re going to ask, but you can see into the future so how can you make mistakes. It is because I allow the beings I create to have free will, but I won’t allow them to destroy my worlds since that would take the free will of others away and wouldn’t give them a chance to live. This is why I punish people or any being sometimes to ensure the balance is maintained, but it does not mean I don’t regret it, which is why I promise you I will never test your loyalty to me by abandoning you again, however, you can choose to abandon me, which would be your choice. I know you have many questions, such as where did the other ancient ones or I come from and did I create the other ancient ones, but you will have to learn this on your own because I want to see how loyal these humans are to me through belief I don’t want you giving them all the answers. Just as you’ve shown me your loyalty they must show me theirs. Before I go I want to let you know as a reminder of this day you will lose all of your vocabulary since it was your words that caused my other followers to betray me, but I want you to know it is not your fault that Dutch Angel Dragons were banished from Paradise it was the other ancient one, which is why it will remain in the Abyss. However, its followers will do its work. I will also give you back all of your powers that you came into existence with. Goodbye, for now, Repeat, I love you and always will no matter what your decision is.”</p>
         <p style="margin-left:0.5in; margin-right:0.5in;">
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> (Repeat forgot its words and blew a kiss to the sky instead)</p>
        
        <h2><u>Repeat's Second Major Betrayal:</u></h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat continued with its “Father’s” orders and succeeded at all of the tasks, but one. It began to hate people that fell to darkness and committed atrocities that were indescribable. Along with this, it hated people that twisted its “Father’s” teachings, such as when Pope Urban II declared a Holy War known as the Crusades to justify killing non-believers. After the death of innocents, Repeat started to daydream about killing all those that committed evil eventually a darkness was formed inside of Repeat stripping it of its innocence changing its once all white coat to black, except for its nose. After this, beings from the Abyss started to mess with Repeat’s thoughts since they knew its mind was vulnerable. Soon thoughts of killing the evil people turned into thoughts of destroying all life since it was the only way to bring peace since without life no evil can be created. Eventually, Repeat manipulated life and created a deadly disease to wipe out humans. Once the disease was created Repeat realized what it had made with what little light that remained within it and tried to destroy it, however, multiple Angel Dragons from the Abyss appeared before Repeat and stole the disease and dragged Repeat into the Abyss to feed off of its pain and destroy the light that was their enemy. The disease was then release resulting in thousands dying and is known as the “Black Plague” today.</p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">In the Abyss Repeat’s white nose began to fade to black as the darkness consumed it until the light that remained was the size of a penny. The other Angel Dragons in the Abyss along with other beings began to feed on its pain and suffering and started showing images of millions dying from what Repeat had created. As Repeat was about to fall to darkness the small spec of white on its nose began to glow and Repeat began to feed on the power emitting from it. When this happened all members of the Abyss began attacking repeat physically and mentally, without prevail. The spec of light Repeat focused on allowed it to shield itself and soon its coat began to become white again, however, it still had blackness mixed in. Soon all the beings of the Abyss became fearful of Repeat as its wings and body began to illuminate a bright white blinding them all just as it had once done in Paradise with its ring. Repeat crawled its way out of the Abyss and returned to Terra where it felt the pain and suffering of millions dying. The dark strands that were now on its fur began to grow like tree branches consuming Repeat’s innocence again. Repeat realized that this black fur wasn’t a scar from the Abyss, but true darkness that entered its way into Repeats body. It began feeding off of the pain of the world and Repeat started to panic since it didn’t know what to do to stop it. Eventually, Repeat essence was completely consumed by darkness, except for one spot in its soul the size of a pinhead.</p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat began to develop an extreme amount of hatred to the ancient one that resided in the Abyss that had caused this, which fed the darkness even more, yet the amount of light in Repeat stayed the same and couldn’t be corrupted for some reason. Repeat began to enslave humans in masses forcing them to worship his “Father” and spreading nightmares of chaos and death to those that defied him. Where ever Repeat went life died and barren wastelands were created. It soon began to crave power from the suffering of others, yet it knew that if it killed them that human souls either went to the Abyss or Paradise. Seeing that humans faced judgment from the ancient one Repeat had promised its loyalty to they were protected until judgment was cast, however, their souls could be stripped out of them if they had any darkness in them. So Repeat began consuming souls to torment those that had performed acts of evil no matter how small they were. This led to the world falling into darkness as it had in the beginning when Angel Dragons were in pain when they were first banished. While the darkness consumed Repeat all of sudden it froze in fear when Telephone appeared before it.</p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Telephone’s ring on its nose was glowing and was emitting the power that was from Paradise. Behind Telephone other Dutch Angel Dragons appeared some having emotions of hatred towards Repeat, others fear, and many wanted Repeat to be destroyed. Repeat fed off of these emotions giving it more power than before. Telephone’s ring began to illuminate brighter than ever showing the power it held to Repeat, it far surpassed its, although Repeat could still cause physical harm to Telephone with the hatred it had fed off of. This was shown when Repeat flung its tail at Telephone sending it flying for several miles, yet Telephone instantly returned and one of its followers healed its wounds. Again and again, Repeat lashed out at Telephone, yet Telephone never fought back, which angered many Angel Dragons since they wanted revenge for the pain it had caused Telephone. However, none of them challenged Telephone’s power since they sensed the power of its ring as well. Repeat continued to lash out at Telephone and eventually became furious since it couldn’t kill it. Repeat began to feed off of its own frustration and anger building up, even more, power, while Telephone simply hovered in the air staring at Repeat. With one final swing of its tail using all of its power Repeat made the Earth tremble scaring the humans and feeding off of their fear further increasing its strength in mid swing. Repeat’s tail grew 8ft long black spikes in that moment that were headed directly towards Telephone’s head. All of a sudden Repeat froze and the spikes stopped 1cm from its enemy’s head. The other Angel Dragons didn’t know what was going on and were baffled by this turn of events. Repeat’s tail began to turn white and its fur throughout its body began to change back to normal. All that was left black was Repeat’s nose. This whole time Telephone had been having a battle with Repeat apparently, but not physically. Instead, Telephone concentrated on thoughts of love and kindness because it knew who Repeat was since its memory was never erased, by the ancient one Repeat served. Due to Telephone never breaking it oath there was no need to erase Repeat from its memory since it was still trusted by the ancient ones. This whole time Telephone knew who this being was and what it was capable of, while at the same time it knew that it was the ancient one that had created disorder that forced Repeat to do these actions against its will. Just by having one slip up the ancient one swooped in and fed negative thoughts to destroy Repeat and its work since Repeat stood in the way of it spreading darkness.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Once Repeat came to it saw Telephone and instantly blanked out as if it went to another dimension with its mind. Repeat’s “Father” showed it images of what it would have become if Telephone had not fed Repeat positive energy, yet Repeat still had hatred towards humans for what they had done, even after experiencing all of that it had not learned its lesson. So Repeat’s “Father” shared with Repeat what it had forgotten, which was that its “Father” feels the emotions of all including sadness. Repeat was shown how much pain it had caused its “Father” and how much pain humans in the world caused each other. This emotion overwhelmed Repeat and soon it remember what it had promised to do and again its “Father” asked it, “Which do you wish to do serve yourself or me?” Repeat chose to serve its “Father” not because it wanted a reward or because it wanted to show its loyalty. It had finally learned something far more significant. That its true purpose is to limit the pain of all life and beings even those that are more powerful than it. Repeat learned that it didn’t care about its own happiness or trying to destroy darkness. Instead, it realized that everything was in some sort of pain and suffering and needed help and love to neutralize it. Even those that have fallen in the Abyss Repeat realized were suffering and needed help, just as Telephone helped it by sensing its own suffering. Sensing Repeat’s realization the ancient one told them, “You have nothing to worry about you have learned the greatest lesson of all and will help all as long as you hold onto this teaching. However, you have been corrupted by darkness and will have to control it to succeed at this goal. Seeing that you remained loyal to your oath of helping others even though you have broken that oath multiple times I will lend you my strength allowing you to use light to cleanse darkness. You, however, will bear a scar to remember the pain you caused and what you suffered through so it will never be repeated again. When you awake you will have a black lightning bolt on your left cheek which will allow you to concentrate all the darkness into one area of your body so it doesn’t corrupt you unless you allow your emotions to get in the way. However, if you fall to darkness again you do not need to worry since all of the light within you will be transferred to this scar allowing you to take back over your body when you realize your corruption. The scar will appear as a lightning bolt to represent your fierceness in resisting darkness. Others may bear this mark as well some representing different shapes based on their personality and strengths. Your job is to make sure that no one will have to go through the pain and suffering of returning from the darkness as you had, yet you do make mistakes which is why you are called Repeat. Seeing that you will be the first to bear this mark I will lend you power to do something that no other Dutch Angel Dragon will be able to do without permanently corrupting itself, this mark will allow you to turn darkness into light by purifying it. Your body will be able to absorb darkness and will represent how much darkness you have obtained by the blackening of your fur. You must be careful though since this can overtake you and you could commit more atrocities, but it won't be forever since the marking will guide you back to the path of light. Repeat I want you to know I will be talking to you less now, but don’t worry that mark your left cheek bears is me standing by your side as you will stand by children’s sides. I will speak to you occasionally when you need a boost of confidence, but just remember you can also feed off of my power through Telephone’s ring and since I’ll be your crutch you will be my children’s as well. My last lesson I can teach you is to rid the world of darkness you’ll need to unite everyone and teach them to accept everyone’s differences no matter how drastic they are. The key to doing this is to teach others the lesson of understanding, so teach them to ask themselves why did this happen or why do they live their lives this way, such as when Telephone understood you were in pain and didn’t jump to conclusions that you were a terrible being since you had consumed millions of souls. Overall, if you aren’t able to understand why someone lives their life the way they do accept them anyways as long as they are not harming others or another life. I have to go now Repeat, but before I do I want to tell you two more things. First, release all of the souls you consumed and second, I love you and always will, goodbye.</p>

        <h2><u>Restoring the World:</u></h2>
        	  <p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat returned back to reality it saw Telephone staring at it, while all the other Dutch Angel Dragons looked on in fear still. Repeat sensed a new type of power it had and its fur was white again and it felt more powerful than it ever had and more love than it could describe. Repeat communicated with Telephone with its limited vocabulary and asked if it would make sure it didn’t hurt any Angel Dragons because it was about to do something dangerous. Telephone agreed and all of sudden darkness began entering Repeats body in what appeared to be tree roots rapidly sprouting out the ground and stabbing Repeat. The darkness penetrated Repeat’s body so viciously its essence could be seen glowing inside, but Repeat stayed alive by healing itself. Soon Repeat’s fur was once again blackened completely all but a tiny patch that was white in the shape of a lighting bolt. This patch began to glow brightly as Telephones ring did and soon an essence of light began to flow out from Telephones ring into Repeat’s scar. Repeat was now feeding off of Telephone’s power and soon its scar began to pulsate with a tremendous amount of power. All of sudden there was a blinding light and large explosion. The Dutch Angel Dragons along with Telephone were temporarily blinded and Repeat appeared to be a glowing white essence in the form of a Dutch Angle Dragon, yet there was a black mark still in the shape of lightning bolt on its left cheek. Knowing that it wouldn’t be able to stay in this form for long due to its limited power Repeat used all of its energy and breathed life back into the lands that it had destroyed. Repeat than asked another Dutch Angel if they could erase the minds of the humans so they would not remember what they had saw since humans too could be corrupt by negative energies and thoughts, so it was done. After restoring the world to what it was Repeat released an overwhelming emotion of love into the world, which settled many Angel Dragon’s hatred towards Repeat, however, the actions that took place that day would never be forgotten by its fellow species. Soon Repeat returned to the Aether and performed small acts of kindness to fellow Angel Dragons and humans, while also practicing its new power, so one day it could return to the world without the darkness consuming it.</p>

        <h2><u>Repeat's Apperance/Safety Concerns:</u></h2>

        <p>Repeat has two forms that it has been seen in, which is a metaphysical and physical form.</p>

        <h2><u>Metaphysical forms:</u></h2>

<p><strong>Light form:</strong> This form is extremely rare to see and is capable of cleansing all forms of darkness. Typically this form is only seen in great times of darkness or when Repeat trusts someone. It normally is seen in secluded areas where there aren’t a lot of witnesses since humans become fearful of the unknown. In this form, it cannot be corrupted by darkness and is at its strongest.
<u>Safety Concerns:</u> There are none. If you see Repeat in this form it’s perfectly safe to approach. If you touch it you will feel an extreme emotional force of love take over you and will feel as though all your worries and anxieties were lifted off of your shoulders.</p> 

<p><strong>Dark form:</strong> This form is possible, but has never occurred yet. Based on past events we can only assume that it will spread pain and chaos throughout the world. However, it can be led back to the light due to the scar it bears.
<u>Safety Concerns:</u> Extremely dangerous. Do not approach at all if you see this form. This form has never been seen so there isn’t much to discuss.</p>

<h2><u>Physical Forms:</u></h2>

<p><strong>White Coat (Rare):</strong>In this form Repeat is very gentle and kind and loves playing games. It acts like an innocent child, yet holds onto an extreme amount of power without knowing it. However, it can be corrupted quite easily just a child can be manipulated. It has been known to heal people in this state and only wishes to see everyone smile and enjoy themselves.
<u>Safety concerns:</u> None. If you see Repeat in this state it is perfectly safe to approach, however, if thoughts of darkness are around it can corrupt it. Also, try not let Repeat touch its scar when in this form it becomes extremely scared and can cause it to feed off of fear and despair destroying this state of innocence. Each time it goes into this form though it takes more darkness to corrupt it, which is why some predict that it may one day be able to permanently stay in this state.</p>

<p><strong>White and Black Coat (Common Form):</strong> This is the most typical form that Repeat appears in. Its fur is mostly white but will have blackness throughout. The darkness can rearrange itself based on the emotions of the world, yet Repeat has learned to manipulate it into different patterns based on what it likes to look like. Repeat is still very gentle in this state, but will get into trouble sometimes by playing jokes on others. It likes to have fun and will play any game that seems fun to it. In this state, it still has the ability to heal people, but only does so if it doesn’t disturb the balance of things, but it will try to make people smile no matter what since it desires to take people’s pain away.
<u>Safety concerns:</u>Variable. In this state, Repeat can either go into a state of mainly light or darkness, but it depends upon the emotions of others and its surroundings. Most likely it will remain in this form due to the natural balance of the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Black Coat (Rare):</strong> In this form Repeat is very dangerous and feeds off of the fear and despair of others. It will try to corrupt your mind and force you to abide by its own will, however, since it bears a mark of light on its left cheek in this form anyone who has any love in them cannot be forced to obey, but if they have one thought of darkness they will fall.
<u>Safety Concerns:</u> Don’t approach at all costs. Repeat will try to consume your soul to torment you for all of eternity or until it reverts back to the light. If you are being stalked by it think of love and kindness to try to revert it back to the light. You will be most successful if you can think of true love and direct those emotions towards Repeat itself. If you can’t do this, your essence will be consumed and you will experience the worst amount of pain beyond your comprehension.</p>

<h3><u>Other Color arrangements:</u></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat can be combined with many color arrangements between black and white. It could be completely black with a white nose or vice versa. It can be half black and white and so on and so forth. To know how safe its is to approach depends on which color it has more of, if it has more white fur than your safe, if more black than you are most likely in danger.</p>

<h3><u>Eyes:</u></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat eyes are white since they spend most of their day looking up into the sky remembering Paradise and what it used to be. This has resulted in it staring at the sun for multiple hours, which eventually destroyed its eyes. Its original eye color was a deep blue and is said that if you looked into them they could bring you feelings of peace and tranquility. Its eyes today have been known to glow blue or purple based on the light or darkness it holds within. If its eyes glow blue then you are safe even if it’s completely corrupted by darkness (complete black fur), if they are purple you are in danger even if their fur is completely white. However, sometimes they have a one blue and one purple eye, which means it will only take one event to tip the scale to either darkness or light. You will be in no harm while Repeat is in this state, but if the scale tips to darkness it may devour your soul instantaneously depending on your emotions at the time.</p>

<h3><u>Tongue:</u></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat’s tongue is a solid white color where most of its power is concentrated. So far it has never had this source of light corrupted beside the time it had its battle with Telephone.</p> 

<h3><u>Scar:</u></h3> 
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat’s scar appears white when it has been corrupted by darkness or black when it is in control of itself.</p>

    <h3><u>Powers/Abilities:</u></h3>

<p><strong><u>Light:</u></strong>This is its main power, which is used to destroy the darkness in the world and bring love and kindness in its place. Using this light it has the capability of releasing all of its feathers off of its wings spreading them throughout the world, which then enters people’s bodies draining them of all darkness and soon the feathers return to Repeat. It then converts the corrupted feathers back to the light, however, this is an extremely rare event and has only been seen when Repeat restored the world from the darkness it had created.</p>

<p><strong><u>Darkness:</u></strong>Although Repeat cannot hold two contradicting powers at the same time just as other Angel Dragons can’t it does not mean one power can’t consume the other. If darkness consumes Repeat it will destroy life and bring pain and torment, yet due to its scar it resists this and is rare for it to turn into the form that it did when it fought Telephone.</p>

<p><strong><u>Healing/Life:</u></strong> It has the ability to breathe life into things as well as heal the wounds. Along with this it has recently learned how to heal things by licking wounds and it is said that if it licks a person or being it will be immune to all sicknesses and diseases, however, it rarely does this since it could disturb the balance of things. Along with this in some rare instances when Repeat cries over the loss of life its tears can bring back the dead if it has no thoughts of darkness. This sadly is rare since beings from the Abyss will do whatever they can to stop this by implanting thoughts and whispering to Repeat to interrupt them.
<u>What to do if you get licked:</u> You feel peace and kindness and all your sicknesses and diseases will be cured, however, if you began to have any feelings besides love and kindness the gift will be lost, unless Repeat decides to lick you again.</p>

<p><strong><u>Manipulation of Time:</u></strong>Repeat has only learned how to slow time down so it can stop tragic events from happening, however, it won’t do this if it disturbs the natural balance of the universe.</p>

<p><strong><u>Manipulation of Air:</u></strong> Not its strongest power, but it loves making pictures in the sky with clouds.</p>

<h3><u>Personality/Behavior:</u></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">Repeat mainly likes to have fun and play games with people. It loves teasing people and playing jokes on them, however, if it feels that you are getting upset with them they will normally stop. It is normally well behaved, but can become super hyper and out going if it feels comfortable around a crowd. Although it is friendly and approachable, it has trust issues due to the pain it has felt in the past. However, once it trusts you it will never leave your side or betray you, but if that trust is broken it is extremely difficult to regain. This does not mean Repeat will leave your side it just means it won’t share with you as much as it would if it trusted you. Repeat also loves giving people kind dreams and taking their pain away while they sleep. Repeat never needs sleep and continues to help the world at night by meditating and giving out kind dreams to the world, however, it will sleep if it senses that it needs to enter someone’s dream with all of its power to help that person or at least take away their darkest pain and suffering.</p>

<h3><u>Stories of Repeat playing with the world:</u></h3>

<p><strong><u>White Rings in the Sky:</u></strong> Repeat misses its ring around its muzzle since it symbolized its oath to the ancient one it served. Due to this, it manipulates cloud patterns to make rings in the sky. It mainly does this now not to only remind the other Dutch Angel Dragons of why they are here but as symbol of unity. Repeat only likes using clouds that are white, however, there have been rings in the sky using gray or black clouds, which are members from the Abyss making fun of Repeats ideals. It is rumored that the rings Repeat makes along with the members of the Abyss are portals connecting our realms allowing for positive or negative forces to enter our world.</p>

<p><u>Repeat's Cloud Ring:</u></p>

 <p><u>Ring from Dutch Angel Dragons from the Abyss:</u></p>

<p><strong><u>Orbs of Light:</u></strong>Repeat has been known to conjure orbs of white light that travel around the world, allowing Repeat to see all the events that are taking place and where Repeat is most needed. It tries to hide these orbs from humans by manipulating the air around it, but sometimes it reveals them to those that need hope. Other times lets everyone see them since it likes playing games with people and teasing them for fun. These orbs have a positive source of energy and are capable of bridging the Aether and Terra realms together allowing forces of positive energy to come out of the Aether. In some rare instances the beings that come from the Aether that feed off of the positive energies will possess the orbs and Repeat will give it to them to allow them to go around and spread kindness to the world before they have to return to the Aether. However, most people have cast out these orbs as some sort of natural phenomenon, a UFO, or a hoax.</p>

<h3><u>Repeat’s Current Task:</u></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 00.5in;">As of now Repeat is concentrating on uniting the world by educating all beings not to hate others based on their differences, but to accept them no matter their beliefs, lifestyles, or other aspects as long as it doesn’t endanger the lives of others. Repeat, however, does still have hatred towards the ancient one in the Abyss. To resist from falling to the Abyss again Repeat concentrates on bringing love and happiness to all instead of concentrating on its hatred. Repeat has recently begun forgiving other fallen Dutch Angel Dragons from the Abyss by stripping the darkness from them and giving them its power to fill them with light and love. However, it can only do this if the Angel Dragons from the Abyss are willing and accepting of this gift.</p>
